# ChorBazaar
E-Commerce Shopping Website

This Website is built using MERN Stack.

It includes featured like login, admin, user, add Product, remove Product and many more.

I have used React JS for frontend and Backend is supported by MongoDB.

The password is hashed using bcrypt and then saved.

The information from Backend to Frontend is done using npm package Axios.

Bootstrap has been used to implement Navigation Bar and Made responsive using Toggle .

Because of limited space of 512MB I have not allowed the images to appear in the all products section .

I will also add the logout feature to the Site and many more.

This project is open to PR's and Suggestions :)

Thank You !!!!!
